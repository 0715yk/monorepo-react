    lyrics: `[Intro]
    
Yeah, trust me

[Verse]

I fell down a wishing well
I fell for a wish from hell
Do we all live for everyone else?
Now I write my name alone in the waiting room
Fifteen in fluorescent light
Pretty sure they can tell I'm high
And it seems like a blatant lie that I'm sitting [?] know what to say now

[Pre-Chorus]

I don't wanna waste your time
I'm sure that I must seem fine
But these thoughts control my mind
I can't take another day where I

[Chorus]

Cry your eyes out
Let your mother down
Let me know now
Am I just getting older?
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am

[Verse]
Now it's 10 years til it comes to light
And it's still the worse at night
Cuz I keep those memories mine
Fuck CBT and
Fuck all the meds I took
My room was a sacred sign
Doors closed, eyes shut, I'm fine
And this emptiness it's mine
I'm sitting and don't know what to say

[Pre-Chorus]

I don't wanna waste your time
I'm sure that your friends won't mind
But these thoughts control my mind
I can't take another day where I

[Chorus]

Cry your eyes out
Let your mother down
Let me know now
Am I just getting older?
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am

[Bridge]

You say you know but you never know
Why can't I try just to let it go?
I'm tied up tight cuz nobody knows
I'm still alone, alone in my bedroom
I hold out hope to forget it all
I'm stuck on hold, alone in the waiting room

[Chorus]

Cry your eyes out
Let your mother down
Let me know now
Am I just getting older?
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am
I am, I am, I am, I am, I am`

    lyrics: `[Verse 1]
    
広い宇宙の数ある一つ
青い地球の広い世界で
小さな恋の思いは届く
小さな島の あなたの元へ

[Verse 2]

あなたと出会い 時は流れる
思いを込めた 手紙も増える
いつしか二人 互いに響く
時に激しく 時に切なく

[Pre-Chorus]

響くは遠く 遥か彼方へ
優しい歌は 世界を変える

[Chorus]

ほら!
あなたにとって大事な人ほど
すぐそばにいるの
ただ!
あなたにだけ届いて欲しい
響け恋の歌

[Post-Chorus]

ほら ほら ほら
響け恋の歌

[Verse 3]

あなたは気付く 二人は歩く
暗い道でも 日々照らす月
握りしめた手 離すことなく
思いは強く 永遠誓う
永遠の淵 きっと僕は言う
思い変わらず同じ言葉を

[Pre-Chorus]

それでも足りず
涙に変わり
喜びになり
言葉にできず
ただ抱きしめる ただ抱きしめる

[Chorus]

ほら!
あなたにとって大事な人ほど
すぐそばにいるの
ただ!
あなたにだけ届いて欲しい
響け恋の歌

[Post-Chorus]

ほら ほら ほら
響け恋の歌

[Bridge]

夢ならば覚めないで
夢ならば覚めないで
あなたと過ごした時
永遠の 星となる

[Chorus]

ほら!
あなたにとって大事な人ほど
すぐそばにいるの
ただ!
あなたにだけ, 届いて欲しい
響け恋の歌
ほら!
あなたにとって大事な人ほど
すぐそばにいるの
ただ!
あなたにだけ届いて欲しい
響け恋の歌

[Post-Chorus]

ほら ほら ほら!
響け恋の歌`

Oh, oh-oh
Oh

[Chorus: Billy Ray Cyrus]

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more (Kio, Kio)

[Verse 1: Lil Nas X]

I got the horses in the back
Horse tack is attached
Hat is matte black
Got the boots that's black to match
Ridin' on a horse, ha
You can whip your Porsche
I been in the valley
You ain't been up off that porch, now

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: Lil Nas X]

Ridin' on a tractor
Lean all in my bladder
Cheated on my baby
You can go and ask her
My life is a movie
Bull ridin' and boobies
Cowboy hat from Gucci
Wrangler on my booty

[Refrain: Lil Nas X]

Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'
Can't nobody tell me nothin'
You can't tell me nothin'

[Chorus: Lil Nas X]

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3: Billy Ray Cyrus]

Hat down, cross town, livin' like a rockstar
Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

[Chorus: Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus]

Yeah, I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more`
